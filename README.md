# Coding-Ninjas-Competitive-Programming
This Repository Contains all my codes which I wrote during the competitive programming course with <a href="https://www.codingninjas.com/">Coding Ninjas</a>
Important lectures and questions to revised again(bookmarks):
1. Oscillating prices of chakri in prerequisites lecture
2. Arrays and pointers video lecture in lecture: pointers(optional to understand c++)
3. "what is the output" question after arrays and pointers video lecture in lecture: pointers(optional to understand c++)
4. characters and pointers video lecture in Lecture : Pointers(Optional To Understand C++)
5. Address type casting in lecture :dynamic allocation(optional to understand c++)
6. reference and pass by reference video lecture in Lecture : Dynamic Allocation(Optional To Understand C++)
7. second and third fill the output question after macros global variable video lecture in Lecture : Dynamic Allocation(Optional To Understand C++).
8. First index of a number in lecture: basics of recursion
9. Last index of a number in lecture :basics of recursion. Although i did it in the firat attempt, but i liked this one.
10. all indices of number in lecture: basics of recursion.
11. time and space complexity analysis lecture is very important.
12. live question 1 in time and space complexity lecture.
13. live question 2 in the lecture time and space complexity analysis.
14. live question 3 in lecture language tools. i can;t do it.
15. warm reception in language tools.. it is a very good question. clears all the concepts of time complexity.
16. triplet sum in language tools + time complexity assignment.
17. longest consecutive sequence in lecture language tools + time and complexity assignment
18. aggressive cows problem in searching and sorting applications. - i did it myself and is a very good problem.
19. aggressive cows and inversion count problems are searching ans sorting applications respectively. these are very important.
20. searching and sorting applications lecture is very very important.
21. last question of advanced recursion.
22. alpha code question in dynamic programming-1.
23. largest bitonic subarray in dynamic programming -1 lecture. (I raised a doubt regarding this. I couldn't do it myself).
24. dynamic programming-1 live question 1.
25. dynamic programming-1 live question 2
26. dynamic programming -1 -minimum count question.
27. adjacent bit count and the problem before that are important. these are for the basic concept. in dynamic programming-1.
28. All the assignment questions in DP-1 are important af.
29. last problem of DP-1 is also very important, I couldn't do it myself
30. balika vadhu probelm in dp-2.
31. Trader Profit in dp2.
32. Distinct subsequences in dynamic programming 2.
33. shortest subsequence in dp2.
34. weighted job scheduling in greedy problems(very very important)
35. 2vs3 in segment trees
36. Prims algorithm in graphs 2
37. connected horses in advanced graphhs. (edited)
